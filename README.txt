Client Side
The client program can be run by compiling Client.java
This will create an instance of ClientFrame.java which will receive the Page.class file and its handlers.
Once the report has been displayed onto the frame, by selecting the Server IP text area and hitting enter, it will allow you to enter a new student/file.

Server Side
The server program can be run by compiling Server.java

** i have all the test cases inside the Server directory and the sample code in the Client directory **

Note: 
    The wait for receiving the report that will be displayed on the Client side should take 10 seconds.
    When entering the name of a student that already exists, the report inside the student directory will be of the most recent submission, but directory will still contain both files.
